    <descript>
      <abstract>The dataset consists of three raster GeoTIFF files describing the following soil properties in the US: available water capacity, field capacity, and soil porosity. The input data were obtained from the gridded National Soil Survey Geographic (gNATSGO) Database and the Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) Database with Soil Data Development tools provided by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The soil characteristics derived from the databases were Available Water Capacity (AWC), Water Content (one-third bar) (WC), and Bulk Density (one-third bar) (BD) aggregated as weighted average values in the upper 1 m of soil. AWC and WC layers were converted to mm/m to express respectively available water capacity and field capacity in 1 m of soil, and BD layer was used to produce soil porosity raster assuming that the average particle density of soils is equal to 2.65 g/cm3. For each soil property, soil maps with CONUS, Alaska, and Hawaii geographic coverages were derived from separate databases and combined into one file. To replace no data values within a raster, we used data values statistically derived from neighboring cell values. The final product is provided in a GeoTIFF format and therefore can be easily integrated into raster-based models requiring estimates of soil characteristics in the US.</abstract>
      <purpose>This soil dataset can be used in a variety of applications for hydrologic research. We use these data to model Evapotranspiration (ET) with Vegetation ET model that integrates water balance algorithms with remotely sensed phenology data.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>This dataset was compared to similar soil moisture properties datasets:
1) Area- and Depth-Weighted Averages of Selected SSURGO Variables for the Conterminous United States and District of Columbia produced by Michael E. Wieczorek (USGS-WRD MDWSC, Geographer)
2) Global Soil datasets produced by the International Soil Reference and Information (ISRIC â€” World Soil Information)
3) Soil Physical Properties produced and modified by USGS Soil Scientist Norman Bliss
To verify reasonable comparison with other datasets spot check was conducted across the study area that included sample points with different land cover classes, soil types, and topography.</attraccr>

    <complete>This dataset is based on the most complete soil database for the United States. However, some missing values identified as 'No Data' were still present. To minimize data gaps, additional processing step was added to fill missing values with the mean values of neighboring pixels. Most missing values were the result of the presence of water bodies and developed areas. Because the primary usage of this dataset is to model land surface processes in the presence of vegetation cover, it is recommended to use this dataset with an inland water mask to avoid misrepresentation of soil moisture values in the presence of inland water.</complete>

        <procdesc>Input data and tools

Downloaded input data: Gridded National Soil Survey Geographic Database (gNATSGO) for CONUS and Alaska, and  Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) for Hawaii. Also, downloaded Soil Development toolbox provided by the National Resources Conservation Service of the US Department of Agriculture (NRCS-USDA) and added the tools to the ArcToolbox.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Resample

Original 30 m for CONUS and 10 m for Alaska and Hawaii map unit raster was resampled to 90m for faster processing. Tool used: Soil Development Tools &gt;&gt; gSSURGO Raster Toolset &gt;&gt; Resample Mapunit Raster. Spatial resolution 90 m was preserved as the final resolution of the dataset.</procdesc>

Note: this step is different for different soil properties

Available water capacity from gNATSGO and gSSURGO is displayed as a fraction in cm/cm. To get to mm/m, we multiplied the original layer by 1,000 with Raster Calculator tool.

Water Content at 1/3 bar from gNATSGO and gSSURGO is displayed as a percentage of water. To get Field Capacity in mm/m, we multiplied the original layer by 10 with Raster Calculator tool.

Bulk density at 1/3rd bar raster datasets were used as an input parameter to calculate porosity with the following formula:
porosity = (1 - bd/ 2.65)* 1 000,
where bd is bulk density in g/cm3 and 2.65 g/cm3 is average particle density for soils. After using this formula in Raster Calculator, we obtain porosity in mm/m.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Fill missing values

Missing data (mostly related to the presence of water bodies, cities, etc) were filled with Focal Statistics Arc Tool based on the values of neighboring pixels. 
This step was run multiple times to fill the gaps progressively. With this approach, smaller gaps were targeted first and were assigned the mean value of their closest neighbors while larger gaps were filled based on a larger number of neighboring pixels. Number of cells for each step:
1) Focal Statistics 5 by 5
2) Focal Statistics 50 by 50
3) Focal Statistics 500 by 500
4) Focal Statistics 500 by 500</procdesc>

Final rater file was projected from its native USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic Coordinate System to Geographic Coordinate System GCS_WGS_1984 with the tool Project Raster (Data Management).</procdesc>
